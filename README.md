This is a game much like "the world's hardest game", it is made entirely with processing during my Freshman game design class.

The first quarter of the project's history is uncommitted, but after losing all my files due to not saving, I soon learned that commiting my saves online is necesary.

To run the game, you must have processing 3 or 4 installed and run the game.pde file in the application. Then there will be a start button in the top left corner.

The game is by no means perfect as I had a limited time coding this, but I am hoping that whoever decides to come take a look may learn from it.
